This project was auto-generated/merged by the assistant to be Android-ready for Flutter builds.

What I put together:
- lib/main.dart (your app entry)
- assets/images/logo.png
- pubspec.yaml (with flutter_launcher_icons in dev_dependencies)
- flutter_launcher_icons.yaml
- android/ (Gradle files, AndroidManifest, MainActivity.kt, resources)

Important notes / next steps:
1) I could not run `flutter create` in this environment, and I did NOT include the `gradle-wrapper.jar` binary.
   Many CI environments (including Codemagic) will still build using system Gradle, but if the build complains about the Gradle wrapper:
     - On a local machine with Flutter installed, run `flutter pub get` then `flutter build apk` once. This will ensure Gradle wrapper and other generated files are created.
     - OR run `flutter create .` in the project root (it will not overwrite your lib/ or assets but will generate proper android/ files).
2) To generate launcher icons (recommended), run locally or in CI step:
     `flutter pub get`
     `flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main`
3) Then you can zip and upload this project to Codemagic (Upload .zip) and run an Android build.

If you want, I can attempt to add a complete gradle-wrapper.jar (but that requires downloading a binary), or I can provide exact terminal commands to run locally to finalize the project.
